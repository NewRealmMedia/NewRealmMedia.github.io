        <b>Assignment 1 Brief</b>
        <p>Design and produce a small-scale interactive or environment that uses some of the approaches, philosophies, or techniques of limits and constraints, minimalism, ma, and/or wabi-sabi to draw focus to an otherwise overlooked part of interactive or environment design experience. This project should be executed in a rigorous and inventive manner, and should be informed by extensive research and experimentation into how these elements can be translated into a digital design context. </p>
        <b>Minimalism, Ma, Wabi-Sabi</b>
        <p>Surely Wabi-Sabi is a made up word.</p>

        <p>Tech Evangelists want to believe the limit to digital media is all expansive. But it’s not, and that’s okay. As designers we are tasked with looking at these limits and asking how they can help us, and what they can offer us. Consumers have an expectation of freedom with digital media, the limits to this are often hidden from view in an effort to please the “bigger is better” part of our monkey brains. Digital places also importantly occupy physical space. This is the tension we as designers contend with.

            <p><br>Okay cool. So we can look at how we use limits, such as that of the holy door, blessed is thou among everyday things. Briefly reading DOET, I realise the reason Noman got a door named after him, as it is sort of the pinnacle of what he has spent his life researching.  
            </p>
            <p><br> I thought of a door that opens incorrectly into another door, relating to the concept of how a badly designed door remains closed. 
            </p>
            <br>Another concept I thought of was a door mat which has a semi has a quarter circle in one corner, that it may be placed in front of a badly designed door to indicate “hey, heey, don’t leave my goddam takeaway and drinks in front of the door that swings out”
            
            <p><br> Design is an expression of purpose, we must recognise the constraints, 
            recognise as many constrains as possible. 
            </p>
            <br>1) The door may swing two ways. 
            <br>2) The mat may not fit under the door
            <br>3) the mat may be moved
            <br>4) people may not recognise the concept
            <br>5) people may not like the quarter circle style
            
            
            <p><br>Norman, D, states “…design must convey the essence of a device’s operation; the way it works; the possible actions that can be taken; and through feedback, just what it is doing at any particular moment. Design is really an act of communication, which means having a deep understanding of the person whom the designer is communicating. 
            </p>
            <p><br>6) Food delivery drivers are too rushed to care where the food lands
             </p>
             <p> After researching ways to design this door in 3D space; I stumbled upon ProBuilder (experimental) which allowed for boolean shapes in Unity, entirely
                forgetting that I had spent a semester learning how to do this in Maya, and could produce much better shapes through it. Ah well. </p>

        <Div class="PostContentTwo">
            <p>Producing something that shows it’s limits. A limited process. A limited process will create a limited form, probably. Get used to the process of building within constraints. Green eggs and ham has 50 words in total. Dr Suess is a master designer. Figure out a strategy.

                What I learned from the story of green eggs and ham is that to generate something original, limit yourself, i.e the paradox of choice. </p>
                
                <p></p>
                A whole lot of choices leads to the wrong choice. Constraints on creativity lead to breakthroughs.
                
                Constraints help us to move beyond the tyranny of the blank page. Adds structure. Stops choice paralysis. They help us employ new means unconsidered before. 
                
                Looking towards the class example; We can see that the script for drawing only allows the user to draw for a limited time before clearing the artwork when the mouse is lifted. We can employ this further. 
                
                So. From my understanding my motto for generating this project is- Limit to enhance creativity. 
                
                So for my consumer to enhance their creativity, I need to limit their ability. Make them think outside of the box. 
                
                I’m reminded of one of the better simple games I ever played, where you played as a very simple 2d elephant. Each level was identical, jump over the spikes to get to the other side. However, each level had a variation you couldn’t predict. Perhaps this level, controls were reversed. The elephant was on the roof instead of the floor. Jumps sent you flying. It made the player abstractly think of new ways to approach a simple task and destination. 
                
                This is not at all what I need to make. It’s just a nice idea of pumping new constraints to a user every level. 
                
                <p>
                So How can I limit my users choices, and enhance their creativity?
                
            </p>
                I began, and quickly altered a concept for creating bad music. 
                To use affordances to inform users on how beats in music actually work. It was silly; but I did enjoy the process of thinking it out. Imagine 4 horizontal lines, paced evenly apart, the lowest bar on the ground. When a line is clicked, and object falls from it and disappears once it hits the ground, and reappears back to where it fell from to fall again, repeatedly, forever. So we could assume that an object placed on the top bar takes 4 times longer to hit the ground than an object on the lowest bar. If I can provide a bunch of instruments to my user, they could essentially create music that keeps to a beat, by literally showing them how the timing in the song they have created, works. 
                <p></p>
                But this was silly, and overly complex and while I think perhaps there might have been a way to make this work; I do not believe it would have looked particularly nice, nor would it have made it very easy to create music, which is what I was attempting to afford my user. 
                
                <p>
                Then I got a new idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, think beyblades, think marble cart tracks, think pinball, and the claw machine that drops balls instead of grabbing toys. Imagine an arena filled with little pyramids and no floor. You’re in a small room beside this. It’s got a five buttons in the shape of a cross, with the fifth a big red button in the centre. 
                </p>
                
                One could state that all games are based on limitations and constraints. However, none are quite as apparent to me as that of the game of pinball. The limits and constraints are made apparent almost immediately when playing for the first time. Indirectly controlling a metal ball just outside of reach which may at any time, succumb to gravity and your limited efforts of control, and slip by just out of reach. I thought of different potentials with this; and then I considered the combining of this with music; could I force my user to play a nice song? I appreciate the recent movement of rube Goldberg machines that essentially map out a well known song and have it played by a little metal ball. I considered giving my viewer the ability to drop a metal ball on a number of objects which offer different note values, generating an original song of utter gibberish. 
                <p></p>
                I developed this by considering use of a pentatonic scale of music, whereby all notes would be harmonic to create an overlapping polyrhythm. 
                <p></p>
                I would then map out and create a clear system for my user to understand that, when a button is clicked here, a ball is dropped there. I would have feedback whereby the player receives a gunshot sfx, letting them know their ball had been deployed. Mapping out the drop zone using shadows. Creating an obvious zone for the user to walk around so as to inform their constraints. Basically just using Don Normans techniques to make something cool.
                <p></p>
                I did end up creating a few prototypes of this, 
                My largest one of which disappeared after a crash. 
                Ultimately; while I did enjoy this experiment, I enjoyed the potentials of the minimalist movement more.

    <h3>An object of importance and 255 value</h3>
</div>

<div class="PostContentFour">
    <p>This project took a number of attempts to get right. In the end, it was a combination of making a false UI display and creating two cubes with one vanishing as the user gets close to get a full spectrum effect. 
    </p>

    <p></p>
    Inspirations:
    <p></p>
    <b>
    Filipe Pantone:</b>
    <p></p>
    A defining role in this project was the simple brilliance of colour. As seen in Pantone’s works, a simple concept creates an apparent limitless possibility. Although his works are largely kinematic, it still lead me to consider the role of colour in a minimalistic project. I wanted to create something that the user was a part of, which required their input, similar to that of Pantone’s kinematic sculptures. 
    <p></p><b>
    Sol LeWitt:</b>
    <p></p>
    To represent the process, to blur the line of the physical and conceptual. An object of importance but little value lets us consider the materiality of the object, and the importance of the concept, which becomes part of the art itself. Through a dynamic cube with colours that shift depending on the viewer’s angle, I explore the malleability of perception and the significance of perspective in art and life. I look to the building blocks of the physical world, the insignificance of the small, to the combined efforts that create the colossal; the single pixel, and the 1920x1080 display. Although my project does not explicitly show the process of making an object of importance but little value; it does show the importance of an object made of a value. Questioning how we perceive value, by altering our value based on perception. 
    <p></p>
    This makes the viewer an active participant in the artwork’s creation, an interactive project which as the author, I remove my intention entirely. 
    
    <p></p>
    Essentially; it’s a meta take of minimalist values, with a bit of laughing at the old masters thrown in.
    
    <p></p><b>
    Interactive design:</b>
    <p></p>
    I began this concept after a number of iterative attempts at generating a piece which forces the viewer to forefront the surroundings of a 3d object. Originally, I had hoped to make the viewer examine their ability to see; with an original concept of presenting artwork only visible in the peripheral of the viewers screen. Such that; by reversing our expectations and presenting the blankness of digital space, we could appreciate and witness bare the world that encloses the art. 
    <p></p>
    After considering more potential concepts; I began to realise that without a screen the digital world Is inaccessible. The screen is considered gone the moment we utilise it; the invisible canvas that holds host to the great illusion of everything at all. For what is an object in 3D space, but a clever illusion of a 2D screen. A collection of thousands of pixels tied together momentarily. To view, we must employ an army of pixels; should a single pixel not fall in line, we see and we know. 
    <p></p>
    The greatest illusion is shattered and it becomes an annoyance we must force ourselves to forget. 
    <p></p>
    So; how to show the screen exists, and is a cluster of single cell pixels working in unison. I sought to consider the role of the RGB colour space, and built what I consider to be a representation of a single pixel; it’s role over important; it’s necessity deeply required for our viewing pleasure and yet banal and almost gross to look at. Finally for the users role in accidentally breaking the illusion. By employing techniques seen in Wabi-Sabi; the Japanese art of impermanence, I would allow the user to experience the illusion, cleverly considering it’s temporal location, and then allow them to ‘look into’ the inner workings of the RGB colour spectrum, and never look back. It should be noted, this is not true Wabi-Sabi. It shows no weathering nor objects in a utilised form. Personally, I feel a connection to Wabi-Sabi with this environment. It may however, be closer to a representation of Wabi-Sabi; the flow of time, and an object that can’t return to it’s original form.    <p></p>
    This is the role of my work, to allow the viewer to label it with a value. Whilst the importance of the minimalist movement and it’s conceptual design lives through the project; the value is entirely up to the audience. In a sweeping stage of interactive design; the pixel is so insignificant it requires the viewers interaction in order to provide it value. 
    <p></p>
    This project can also be considered to utilise gestalt psychology; a sense of the indivisible whole. 
    The screen, in this example, is utilised as a piece of the work. Whilst many digital artworks may attempt to transport us into the world; this piece specifically does not. Instead transporting us to a world where we look through a screen, and no matter how much we may want to experience the world unhindered by the piece of glass, we must consider it. 
    <p></p>
    In this project, the screen is divided horizontally and vertically based on screen dimensions of X and Y. Thus, it is the vertical of the screen; the horizontal of the screen, which designates the colour of the cube. Simply put, we must consider the role of the screen and pixels. It is an essential role of this digital world. 
    <p></p>
    Once again, we see that this is a literal and figurative pushback against representation and illusionism. 
    
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p></p>
    As can be seen here, the process for creating this was largely trial and error; The biggest issue I faced was creating using the screens X and Y coordinates, as opposed to the world maps coordinates. Using the world map coordinates resulted in perspective skewing, and less freedom for the cubes placement. 
    <img class="Position" src="img/WorldPosBug.png">
    <p></p>
    Originally, it was developed so anything above 0.0 would be green. This worked as a test, however it quickly became apparent that using this method would lead to an object that needed to be placed in an exact location; furthermore, this test showed that the colour was being generated ‘in world’, as opposed to the glitch effect of being reminded that the screen exists, and has a vertical and horizontal centre. 
    <img class="Perspective" src="img/PerspectiveSkewing.png">
    <p></p>
    
    The next challenge I sought to face, was blending. Blending typically resulted in a murky grey colour, the level of blend was hard to finesse, and I found it was not creating the nice spectrum I had envisioned. Thus, I considered adding a fourth element of saturation, using the final corner to allow the user to increase or decrease the vibrancy of the cube. 
    Ultimately, it was purely a stylistic choice to remove this. While including saturation did make sense from a conceptual point of view, to me, it removed the isolation of RGB. I feel that, seeing over-exposed RGB stripped bare resonated with my concept of pixel colour better. In the end, I simply altered saturation through code
    using a public slider. This allowed me to perfect the blend, and create an aethetically pleasing and vibrant cube.
    <img class="Saturation" src="img/Saturation.png">
    <p></p>
    I grappled with many issues and bugs. 
    By trawling online posts, and watching tutorials, I found I needed to look in to how unity UI is built. After I gathered information I was ready to implement. This proceeded to generate a new set of issues and bugs, so I took my code to ChatGPT, and asked it to help me understand how to implement my code smoothly. 
    <p></p>
    Ultimately, this was a challenging technical process. Considering I focussed my intents on generating a thought provoking concept; I felt it necessary to utilise all tools available and expedite my technical process as much as possible. 
    <p></p>
    The overall process can be simplified as:
    <p></p><b>
    Week 2.1
    <p></p></b>
