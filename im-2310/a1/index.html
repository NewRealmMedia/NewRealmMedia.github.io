                <ol>

                    <li>
                        <strong>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</strong>
                        <ul class="text-block">
                            <li>Acknowledgement of country. Presented as solitary text in the center of the webpage, 
                                allows the viewer to acknowledge the importance of the introduction without being overwhelmed,
                                while a single arrow below the acknowledgement presents a signifier to the user with how to continue. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</strong>
                            <ul class="text-block">
                                <li>Scrolled down,</li>
                                <li>Viewed current exhibitions,</li>
                                <li>Selected 'View All Exhibitions',</li>

                                <li>Selected The Global Life of Design,</li>
                                <li>Viewed introduction video,</li>
                                <li>Scrolled down to view price, date, location of exhibition,</li>
                                <li>Read up on information related to exhibit, artists statement,</li>
                                <li>Selected related exhibit 'Global trade and the rise of luxury',</li>
                                <li>Read through information on exhibit, viewed images of the exhibit,</li>
                                <li>Continued through to 'Pleasure Garden', another exhibit being shown,</li>
                                <li>Listened to audio samples featured in the exhibit.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <li>
                        <strong>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</strong>
                            <ul class="text-block">
                                <li>I engaged most with the artists statement and descriptions of the work.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</strong>
                            <ul class="text-block">
                                <li>Most common action was scrolling down, followed by viewing images and clicking links.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</strong>
                            <ul class="text-block">
                                <li>The primary intended goal of the interactive experience was gaining insight into exhibitions prior to visiting the NGV</li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</strong>
                            <ul class="text-block">
                                <li>Largely through text descriptions of the works. However, this is supported by audio and visuals to provide an informative and multisensory preview of the work</li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</strong>
                            <ul class="text-block">
                                <li>Based on my impression; two or three times, for roughly 10 minutes. Potentially during the days or weeks leading up to the user visiting an exhibit.
                                    However, the homepage lists "Exhibitions" and "Events", featuring listed descriptions are designed to be quickly viewed weekly or monthly to provide a quick rundown of exhibits availble.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</strong>
                            <ul class="text-block">
                                <li>The main signifier of this is the time and dates of exhibits and events. Located aside the link to the full description, and at the beginning of each description webpage</li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference? Listing one or more references that it allows the user to fold in</strong>
                            <ul class="text-block">
                                <li>The NGV website experience references many forms of media. Such as the various media from Pierre Bonnard, utilising paintings, drawings, photographs, folding screens and early cinema. 
                                    Or the ‘Photography: Real and Imagined’ exhibition, presenting 200+ photographic works by Australian and international photographers. 
                                    The experience also folds in many exhibitions in sculpture, design and architecture. 
                                    The experience of the website alone, however, utilises many forms of media to present works to users, such as static image, video, and audio. </li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</strong>
                            <ul class="text-block">
                                <li>The media presented by the NGV provides a suggestion of exploration, education and entertainment. It should be noted that the various forms of media suggest different methods of engagement. 
                                    The references, and the various forms they are presented in suggest to the user to act thoughtful and receptive to new experiences.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</strong>
                            <ul class="text-block">
                                <li>The central suggestion is enlightenment. The information presented and the ways it is presented offers a glimpse into various times, and mentalities throughout the ages.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</strong>
                            <ul class="text-block">
                                <li>Ultimately the most frustrating element of the interaction is the load time for videos and images. 
                                    Whilst the ultimate goal of the website is to provide insight and promotion of various exhibitions, this can be hindered by waiting for media to load. 
                                    Ultimately, whilst the website has great load times, this can make it frustrating to flick through various exhibitions quickly.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</strong>
                            <ul class="text-block">
                                <li>The elegance of the website design. Each insight is balanced in support by various mediums and fitting to the artists intent. 
                                    The website experience feels somewhat like visiting the NGV, discovering various mediums that I had not deeply considered before. 
                                    Equal to this is the navigability of the website as a whole. 
                                    Information hierarchy in headers and footers allow users to draw quick conclusions and move freely through the website.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>
                
                </ol>
